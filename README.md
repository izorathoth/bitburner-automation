# Bitburner Automation
This repository is based on work from [chrisrabe](https://github.com/chrisrabe/bitburner-automation). I intend to update and extend these scripts as I advance through the bitnodes and look forward to when, if ever, chrisrabe continues his series on YouTube.

## Overview
A note from chrisrabe about this repository:
> This repository contains the automation scripts I use to play a programming game called "Bitburner". It's related to the Bitburner series I'm making in [my gaming Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXVoS73T7gn9h4PHghPxpuw). It contains reference code that you can use in your own scripts. Feel free to modify this or clone this.
> For any questions, feel free to flick me an email or leave a comment on my videos. I'm always happy to help :)
